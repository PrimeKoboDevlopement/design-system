## 4.10.0

### Updated

`SideNav`

- Added a default value of "#hds-main" for `a11yRefocusSkipTo`
- Fixed styling issue to prevent `Button` and `Dropdown` nested within another `Dropdown` from inheriting dark theme.

### Deprecated

`SideNav`

Deprecated the `withAppHeader` argument as it is no longer needed. If you are using this argument, simply remove it.

`SideNav::Header::IconButton` 

Deprecated the component. Use the [`Hds::Button` component](/components/button) with isIconOnly set to true as a replacement.
